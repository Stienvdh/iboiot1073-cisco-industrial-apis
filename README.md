# Fantastic APIs on your Factory Floor, and Where to Find Them.

In this repository, you can find the supporting code and documentation for Cisco Live session IBOIOT-1073, titled *Fantastic APIs on your Factory Floor, and Where to Find Them.* This session was delivered by Stien Vanderhallen (contact: stienvan@cisco.com).

These different modules aim to get you started with netoork automation in an industrial context, with an eye for practical OT use cases and tools. Within each module, you will find the relevant code, use case and instructions. 

This repository is relevant **even if you don't have Cisco industrial equipment, or any other equipment than your PC** available. Each module provides you with a "dummy" version of the code that simulates the behaviour of an industrial router/switch. If you do have network equipment available, the root folder code will help you make the most use of that.

Happy programming!

[Module 1 - Use RESTCONF to manage VLANs on your devices](01-restconf)

[Module 2 - Use IOx to environmental monitor conditions on your factory floor](02-iox)

[Module 3 - Use Cyber Vision to get alerted on critical security events in your industrial network](03-cybervision)

[Module 4 - Use IOT Operations Dashboard to give your devices a meaningful name](04-iotod)
